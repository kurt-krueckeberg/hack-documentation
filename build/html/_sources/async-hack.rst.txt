Instead of pre-emptive multitasking, Hack supports cooperative multitasking, allowing functions to execute asynchronously freeing the main calling code to do other things. When you call, for example, 

.. code-block:: php

    $zuck = file_get_contents("https://graph.facebook.com/4");

execution is paused while network packets cross the internet, query a database for an answer, and come back. Database queries can cause simliar I/O latency.  

.. todo:: Provide an practical example showing the syntax of async functions

These functions must be prefixed with  the **async** keyword.
